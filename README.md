# COVID-19-Death-Counts-Line-Chart
This Python project visualizes COVID-19 death counts over time in the United States using data from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). The code loads summarized COVID-19 data from a CSV file, processes it, and generates a line graph to depict death counts from pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19.
